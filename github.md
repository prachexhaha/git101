# Introduction
## Key points
1. creation of repos through profile 
2. while making and update through the website, there is a commit message that pops up - this does not change the name of the file.


## Difference between fork and clone
The two main differences between forking and cloning a repository on GitHub:

1. **Ownership**:
   - **Forking**: When you fork a repository, you create a copy of it under your own GitHub account. This forked repository is independent of the original, allowing you to modify it without affecting the original repository.
   - **Cloning**: When you clone a repository, you create a local copy of it on your computer, but the remote repository remains the same. You don't gain any special ownership or independence from the original repository.

2. **Purpose**:
   - **Forking**: Forking is generally used when you want to contribute to someone else's project or create a personalized copy of a repository that you can modify and potentially submit changes back to the original via pull requests.
   - **Cloning**: Cloning is used to download the repository to your local machine for development, testing, or working on your own projects. You might clone your own repository, a forked repository, or someone else's repository to work on it locally.
